I think I got $250 or $300, can't remember.
Next day, I got out... not sure, maybe $80?

These are only things I can remember:
	Gas - $20
	Boner pills - $85-ish
	T-Shirt, assorted goods from Walmart - $40-ish
	McDonald's breakfast - $30
	Video card - $40-ish
	Bought hardees hambuger + fries while, then two coffees while out and about.
		- Not sure how much. Say $10-ish at most.
	Movies: $16.50?
	Gas, goodies before movies: $20 in gas plus whatever you two bought, say $5.

	I drank off and on throughout day. At least $30 in booze, probably more since
		I was feeling pretty drunky when I got to Kelly's.

	I got home, and drank ~$40 in booze. (Remember, this was a few days after finals --
		this was my "big hurrah" and I drank most of the day (albeit at a slow pace for most of the day
		), not just for a few hours.

	Total: ~$340

	I still had money left over, can't remember how much.
	And, I'm assuredly not accounting for everything; these are just things I can remember.
