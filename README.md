# Encrypted Search Research Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the complete source code, simulation data, related files, and presentations from my research on **encrypted search**. It also includes earlier thesis attempts that did not pan out but are preserved here for posterity. The work is highly disorganized, reflecting the iterative nature of my learning process, but it captures the evolution of ideas and methods in this research area.

## Background

This research directly led to my **Master of Science thesis in Computer Science**:

### *Encrypted Search: Enabling Standard Information Retrieval Techniques for Several New Secure Index Types While Preserving Confidentiality Against an Adversary With Access to Query Histories and Secure Index Contents*
By Alexander R. Towell, Bachelor of Science

A Thesis Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in the field of Computer Science at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (2015).

The research explores **secure index construction for encrypted search**, enabling efficient information retrieval on encrypted data while preserving confidentiality. It investigates several secure index types, analyzes their performance, and models adversaries with access to query histories. The thesis work is rooted in information retrieval, cryptographic security, and efficiency trade-offs.

## Contents

- **Source Code**: Implementations of encrypted search techniques, secure index structures, and adversarial simulations.
- **Simulation Data**: Results from various experiments evaluating search efficiency, confidentiality, and attack resilience.
- **Presentations**: Slides and documents summarizing key findings.
- **Early Thesis Drafts**: Previous attempts at formulating this research in a structured academic format.
- **Final Thesis (2015)**: *"Encrypted Search: Enabling Standard Information Retrieval Techniques for Several New Secure Index Types While Preserving Confidentiality"*.

## Disclaimer

This repository reflects my **earlier work** in the field of encrypted search and information security. While the ideas and implementations remain relevant, my understanding of research methodology and paper writing has improved significantly since this work was conducted. Expect **inconsistencies**, **suboptimal code**, and **unstructured documentation**.

## Why Publish This?

Despite its imperfections, I believe in **open science** and the importance of documenting research progress. This repository serves as a historical reference for anyone interested in **encrypted search, secure index construction, and adversarial modeling**.

## Notes on Repository Structure

Given the lack of organization, you may find files and code that:

- Are redundant or contain overlapping ideas.
- Represent different iterations of the same concept.
- Lack proper comments or documentation.

If you find anything useful or have questions, feel free to reach out.

## Getting Started

To explore the research, you can start by:

1. Reviewing the **thesis document** for a high-level understanding.
2. Checking the **source code** directory for implementations.
3. Looking at **simulation results** to see performance comparisons.

## License

This work is shared under an **open-access philosophy**. Feel free to explore, learn, and build upon it, but **please attribute appropriately** if using any part of it in your work.
