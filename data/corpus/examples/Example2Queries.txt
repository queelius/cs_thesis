Note: psip -- what about a term being assigned the same place (randomly) multiple times?
		*** same for bsib, psib

Test 1: query term

	example				-> example2
	term				-> "tom"
	stemming			-> false
	stop words			-> none

	ii (exact)
			locations	-> 0, 44, 49
			frequency	-> 3
			contains	-> true

	bsib (block size=4)
			locations	-> 0, 11, 12
			frequency	-> 3
			contains	-> true

	psib (block size=4)
			locations	-> 0, 11, 12
			frequency	-> 3
			contains	-> true

	psip (range=0)
			locations	-> 0, 44, 49
			frequency	-> 3
			contains	-> true

	psif
			locations	-> na
			frequency	-> 3
			contains	-> true
