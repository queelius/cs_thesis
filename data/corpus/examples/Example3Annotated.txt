This represents an interesting case for PsiPost, if a query term is:

	"this is phrase one this is phrase two"

0    1  2      3
this is phrase one
4    5  6      7
this is phrase two
8    9  10     11
this is phrase one
12   13 14     15
this is phrase two
16   17 18     19
this is phrase one
20   21 22     23
this is phrase two

no order in the hidden query term is given -- indeed, the order in the secure index is scrambled also, within some
range, so even if the hidden query term was ordered (which would leak information), this information still may
not be used.

all we have are a set of bigrams and/or unigrams, and the objective is to find whether there exists all of them within
some range -- the longest-possible range for any particular phrase of size k, with a random scrambling of radius r, is:

	the first term in the phrase in the document is moved r units left by the secure index, and
	the last term in the phrase is moved r units right. then, the span of the terms in a phrase of k units is:

		k + 2r

	thus, if all of the bigrams of a query term match such that if the lowest term has position j and the highest
	term has position i, then there is true match if |j - i| <= k + 2r

	the smallest-possible range, likewise, is when the first term is moved r units right, and the last term is moved
	r units left in a way that they have a span of zero if k <= 2r. if k > 2r, then:

		minimum span is: k - 2r. since r will tend to be large compared to k, to prevent information leakage, the
		unfortunate reality is that minimum span information may not be used much to weed out false positives.

in the above case, "this is phrase one this is phrase two this is phrase three" matches:

	[0, 7]		-> this makes sense, it is an exact match
	[1, 7]		-> false match -- but contains bigrams: is phrase, phrase one, one this, this is, is phrase, phrase two
					the problem is, there are ways to address this, but i leave that to future work.
	[2, 9]
	[5, 12]
	[6, 12]
	[6, 13]
	[8, 15]		-> this makes sense, it is an exact match
	[9, 15]
	.
	.
	.
	[17, 23]	-> this makes sense, it is an exact match
	[18, 23]
