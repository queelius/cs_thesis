local co-occurrence statistics
    * use a sliding window (of blocks) to find a solution that maximizes
    distance measure.
    
    * words that occur together (within some sliding window) probably share
    a similar context and have similar meanins
    
    * example: check +-k blocks for the terms of a search query (this is
    locality measure).
        - prefer to match large n-grams (or rearrangements of said n-grams)
        within this window.
        
        - instead of considering a message's total of N blocks at a time, we
        only entertain k < N blocks (constant) at a time, doing a single pass
        through all the block windows. so, proportional to k *
        (number of windows) ~ kN
        
            * start with a small window, do the pass
                - get a distance measure for it
                    * for each block, match as many of the keywords as
                    possible
            
            * increase the size of the window, k' = k + c
                - is it better or worse?
                
                
                
WordNet has been studied to expand queries with conceptually-related words
